<p style="font-size:18px;">

Rachel received her osteopathic education from Hamiltonâ€™s Canadian Academy of Osteopathy in 2017 and has been in private practice since 2014. Also a certified yoga teacher, Rachel has been exploring the intersections between movement and health for more than a decade. 
<br><br>
During her undergraduate studies at Ryerson University, Rachel spent her spring and summers working in reforestation in the backcountry of British Columbia. Over the years, this arduous work led to chronic pain affecting her daily life. This is the path that brought her to osteopathy, first as a patient and then a practitioner. 
<br><br>
Rachel is a member of the Ontario Association of Osteopathic Manual Practitioners (OAO) and Osteopathy Canada (OSTCAN).

<i style="font-size:18px;">"Rachel was amazing. She took the time to learn about my health history, walked me through the treatment. She made me feel comfortable and safe. I felt a shift after my first appointment. I'm looking forward to my next few appointments. I have complete confidence my hip pain will continue to subside."</i>

<b style="font-size:18px;">Impressive results with Rachel</b>
<br><br>
<i style="font-size:18px;">"Rachel provided instant relief for my back after a tumble down some stairs left me hobbling around. She took her time to carefully consider the best course of treatment. Her approach was so gentle and sensitive to my needs. In many years of trying different kinds of body work, osteopathy with Rachel has provided the most immediate yet lasting results. She has my highest recommendation!"</i>
